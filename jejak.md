# FLASHPARK - Parking Gate System Documentation

## Overview
FLASHPARK is a comprehensive parking management system with gate entry/exit control, payment processing, and administrative dashboard. The system handles vehicle entry/exit, payments, reporting, and administrative functions.

## Work Completed

### Core System Structure
- Set up Flask application with proper modularization and blueprint organization
- Established database models with SQLAlchemy
- Implemented JWT-based authentication system
- Created rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Added error handling and logging
- Configured environment variables for secure deployment

### Database Models
- `AspNetUsers`: User accounts with authentication data
- `AspNetRoles`: Role definitions for access control
- `AspNetUserRoles`: User-role assignments
- `ActivityLog`: System activity tracking
- `ParkingSpaces`: Parking space inventory and status
- `Vehicles`: Vehicle registration and tracking
- `ParkingTickets`: Entry/exit records for vehicles
- `ParkingRate`: Fee configuration for different vehicle types
- `ParkingTransactions`: Payment records
- `HardwareStatus`: Monitoring of gate hardware

### Authentication & Security
- JWT token-based authentication system
- Access token validation and expiration
- Role-based access control
- Route protection with decorators
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse

### Features Implemented

#### Parking Management
- **Entry Processing**: Record vehicle entry with ticket generation
- **Exit Processing**: Calculate fees and process vehicle exit
- **Space Management**: Track available and occupied spaces
- **Vehicle Tracking**: Monitor vehicles currently in the parking area

#### Payment Processing
- Multiple payment methods support
- Transaction recording and receipt generation
- Payment verification and reconciliation
- Integration with financial reporting

#### Reporting System
- Daily revenue reports
- Weekly usage statistics
- Monthly summary reports
- Custom date range reporting
- Transaction history and auditing
- Occupancy rate analysis

#### Administrative Dashboard
- Real-time parking status overview
- Revenue statistics and charts
- Space utilization visualization
- Recent activity logs
- User management
- System configuration

#### User Management
- User creation and role assignment
- Permission management
- Activity logging and auditing
- Password reset functionality

#### Rate Configuration
- Different rates by vehicle types
- Time-based rate calculations (hourly, daily, monthly)
- Special event or time-of-day pricing
- Maximum daily rate caps

#### Hardware Integration
- Gate control system communication
- License plate recognition integration
- Receipt printer support
- Payment terminal connectivity
- Status monitoring of hardware components

## Technical Details

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: SQLAlchemy with SQLite (configurable for other DB engines)
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens
- **API**: RESTful endpoints with JSON
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Bootstrap
- **Monitoring**: Built-in logging and activity tracking

### API Endpoints
The system provides a comprehensive API, including:

- `/api/auth/*`: Authentication endpoints
- `/api/parking-sessions/*`: Parking entry/exit management
- `/api/payments/*`: Payment processing
- `/api/reports/*`: Reporting and statistics
- `/api/management/*`: Administrative functions
- `/api/dashboard/*`: Dashboard data

### Code Organization
- Models for database entities
- Routes organized by functional area
- Services for business logic
- Utilities for common functions
- Templates for frontend views
- Static assets for UI components

## Deployment Considerations
- Requires Python 3.7+
- Environment configuration via .env file
- Database initialization required on first run
- Hardware integration configuration needed
- SSL recommended for production deployment

## Future Enhancements
- Mobile application for users
- QR code-based entry/exit
- Subscription/membership system
- Integration with third-party payment processors
- AI-based predictive analytics for parking availability
- Automated license plate recognition system
